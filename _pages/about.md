Hi!

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Department of IT Convergence Engineering in Gachon University, Korea, and working as a researcher in [CVIP Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/gachoncvip/home), Gachon University, under the supervision of Prof. [Yong Ju Jung](https://sites.google.com/site/coolyjjung/).
My current research interests include 2D & 3D image processing, computer vision, and deep generative models.

This web presence serves both as my portfolio and my blog.

All of my blogs are written in Bangla, so that, the undergrad students from Bangladesh can easily grasp the underlying concepts of deep learning. This is the least I can do for them - No other reason!


** This site is under major plastic surgery :) . I will update everything soon. Please stay tuned!
