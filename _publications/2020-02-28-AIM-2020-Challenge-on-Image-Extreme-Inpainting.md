**Abstract
This paper reviews the AIM 2020 challenge on extreme im-age  inpainting.  This  report  focuses  on  proposed  solutions  and  resultsfor two different tracks on extreme image inpainting: classical image in-painting and semantically guided image inpainting. The goal of track 1is to inpaint large part of the image with no supervision. Similarly, thegoal  of  track  2  is  to  inpaint  the  image  by  having  access  to  the  entiresemantic segmentation map of the input. The challenge had 88 and 74participants, respectively. 11 and 6 teams competed in the final phase ofthe challenge, respectively. This report gauges current solutions and seta benchmark for future extreme image inpainting methods.
