##### Abstract
This paper reviews the AIM 2020 challenge on extreme image  inpainting.  This  report  focuses  on  proposed  solutions  and  results for two different tracks on extreme image inpainting: classical image in-painting and semantically guided image inpainting. The goal of track 1is to inpaint large part of the image with no supervision. Similarly, the goal  of  track  2  is  to  inpaint  the  image  by  having  access  to  the  entire semantic segmentation map of the input. The challenge had 88 and 74p articipants, respectively. 11 and 6 teams competed in the final phase of the challenge, respectively. This report gauges current solutions and set a benchmark for future extreme image inpainting methods.
