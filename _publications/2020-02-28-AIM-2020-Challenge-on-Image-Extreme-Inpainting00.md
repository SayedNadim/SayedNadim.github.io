##### Abstract
With the mounting interest on cognitive radio (CR) technology in wireless communication systems, it is anticipated that CR-enabled vehicular networks will play a vigorous role in the enrichment of communication efficiency in vehicular network. This paper presents a Cognitive Radio enabled VANET for multi-agent based intelligent traffic management system. A skeleton for intelligent learning and decision mechanism for Central Traffic Management is also proposed and discussed in the model. The proposed model has two distinct information exchange system layouts. One is dynamic (vehicle to vehicle) and another is semi-dynamic (vehicle to Road-Side-Unit). For the vehicle-2-vehicle communication, the proposed model assumes that vehicles can communicate with each other using available wireless resources with the help cognitive radio mechanism. This paper also introduces a cluster formation scheme for better accuracy in data transmission among vehicles. The dynamic module of the proposed model is later simulated and validated for some important performance communication metrics.
