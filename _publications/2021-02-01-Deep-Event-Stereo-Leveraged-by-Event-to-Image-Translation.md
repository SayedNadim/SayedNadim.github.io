##### Abstract
Depth estimation in real-world applications requires precise responses to fast motion and challenging lighting conditions.Event cameras use bio-inspired event-driven sensors that provide  instantaneous  and  asynchronous  information  of  pixel-level  log  intensity  changes,  which  makes  them  suitable  for depth  estimation  in  such  challenging  conditions.  However,as  the  event  cameras  primarily  provide  asynchronous  and spatially  sparse  event  data,  it  is  hard  to  provide  accurate dense disparity maps in stereo  event camera setups - especially in estimating disparities on local structures or edges. In this study, we develop a deep event stereo network that re-constructs spatial image features from embedded event data and leverages the event features using the reconstructed image features to compute dense disparity maps. To this end,we propose a novel image reconstruction sub-network with a  cross-semantic  attention  mechanism.  A  feature  aggregation sub-network is also developed for accurate disparity estimation, which modulates the event features with the reconstructed image features by a stacked dilated spatially-adaptive denormalization mechanism. Experimental results reveal that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by significant margins both in quantitative and qualitative measures.
